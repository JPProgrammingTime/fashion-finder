# Fashion Finder


## Getting Started

Clone repository: ` git clone git@github.com:rtfdm/fashion-finder.git`.
Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Development

#### Serving

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is being used as a bundler.

Use `npm run start` to start the development server. Then visit `localhost:1234` to view the development website.

Hot reloading is enabled.

#### Testing

[Jest](https://parceljs.org/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) are being using for testing.

Use `npm run test` to run the test suits. 

#### Building

User `npm run build` to build the application. This outputs a `./dist` folder, which isn't version controlled. However, the build script is required for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)).
